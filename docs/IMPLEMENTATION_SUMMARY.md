## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Schema Deprecation Warnings**
   - Some `pgTable` signatures show deprecation warnings
   - These are from Drizzle ORM and don't affect functionality
   - Will be addressed in future Drizzle updates

2. **Category Mapping**
   - RemoteOK category mapping may not be 100% accurate
   - Some jobs may not have a category assigned
   - Manual review and adjustment may be needed

3. **Skill Extraction**
   - Keyword-based extraction may miss some skills
   - May extract false positives
   - Consider using NLP or AI for better extraction

4. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Currently only checks `sourceUrl`
   - Same job from different sources won't be merged
   - TODO: Implement fuzzy matching on company + title

---

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics after implementation:

- ✅ Number of job categories created: **30**
- ✅ Number of data sources: **4** (V2EX, Eleduck, RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely)
- ⬜ Number of jobs crawled per day: **TBD**
- ⬜ Number of unique skills identified: **TBD**
- ⬜ Crawler success rate: **TBD**
- ⬜ User engagement with new filters: **TBD**
